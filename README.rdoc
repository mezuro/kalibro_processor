Kalibro Processor is a source code analysis web service. Part of the Kalibro.

It was strongly based on the vintage Kalibro (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro) written in Java mostly by Carlos Morais (carlos88morais at gmail dot com) on his MSc dissertation (in portuguese http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-25092013-142158/en.php)

=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.1

* Ruby version

  2.1.2

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    bundle install

* Database creation

    rake db:setup

* How to run the test suite

    rake

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  Kalibro Gatekeeper v0.1.1 (https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_gatekeeper/releases/tag/v0.1.2)
  You can find a script to install it on any machine with Rails on https://gist.github.com/rafamanzo/9859244. After running this script, run ```unset BUNDLE_GEMFILE```.
  By default Kalibro Processor will expect it to be running on port 8081 at localhost.
  In order to run it as expected, run: ```rails s -p 8081```.



* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have the password.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

* First Deploy

  1. Make sure that the deployment file <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> is correctly configured to the installation server;
  2. Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm installed;
  3. <tt>cap deploy:setup</tt> will install the ruby correct ruby version, the gemset and all the directories tree;
  4. <tt>cap deploy:migrations</tt> deploys the code and run all the migrations
